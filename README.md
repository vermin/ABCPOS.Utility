What is Bitcon Cash?
---------------------

[Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) is an experimental digital currency
that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer
technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing
money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of
Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core
when the two split on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of
Bitcoin share the same transaction history up until the split.
